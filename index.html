        <p>       
          I am a Masters student at Ontario Tech University pursueing a Master of Science in Computer Science.
          My research area focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically working with visual data and looking
          at ways for Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and interpret them. I am eager to contribute my skills and 
          knowledge to a dynamic company where I can work diligently and make a meaningful impact

          <p>
            NewsFlash is a user-friendly social media platform developed as a school project using Flutter and Dart. Our goal was
            to create a simple and intuitive application that combines the power of Flutter's cross-platform capabilities with Dart's
            efficient programming language. NewsFlash offers a seamless and visually appealing experience, focused on real-time news updates
            and connecting users.

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In this school project, the aim is to explore Netflix data using R Studio. Utilizing tools such as group_by, summarise, mean, ggplot,
            filter, mutate, replace_all, and remove_all, various data techniques are applied to gain insights into user preferences and content
            performance. Through data filtering and analysis, interesting trends and patterns are uncovered. Visualizations created with ggplot 
            enhance the understanding of the findings, presenting them in an engaging and informative manner. Join this exploration into the world 
            of Netflix data, showcasing skills in filtering, analysis, and visualization using R Studio for this school project.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Advanced Association Rule Mining Techniques for Large-Scale Datasets using Python</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In this school project, I implemented and compared several advanced association rule mining algorithms, including the Apriori algorithm,
            PCY algorithm, Random Sampling, SON algorithm, and the multihash version of the PCY algorithm. The primary objective was to uncover meaningful 
            associations and frequent itemsets within massive datasets, and to assess the performance and effectiveness of each algorithm in this context. 
            I conducted thorough experiments, analyzing various factors such as runtime efficiency, memory utilization, and the accuracy of association rule 
            discovery. To evaluate the algorithms, I utilized two diverse datasets and explored different sample percentages (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%) as 
            well as support thresholds (1%, 2%, and 5%). I also paid specific attention to the number of false positives for Random Sampling, shedding light on 
            its performance in the association rule mining domain.

          <p>
            In 2023, I actively participated in the Advent of Code, successfully solving daily programming puzzles throughout the month of December using Python. 
            This engaging experience not only allowed me to deepen my proficiency in Python but also required the application of a vast array of data structures and 
            algorithms to solve each problem which taught me something new everyday.

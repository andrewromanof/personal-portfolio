        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In this school project, the aim is to explore Netflix data using R Studio. Utilizing tools such as group_by, summarise, mean, ggplot,
            filter, mutate, replace_all, and remove_all, various data techniques are applied to gain insights into user preferences and content
            performance. Through data filtering and analysis, interesting trends and patterns are uncovered. Visualizations created with ggplot 
            enhance the understanding of the findings, presenting them in an engaging and informative manner. Join this exploration into the world 
            of Netflix data, showcasing skills in filtering, analysis, and visualization using R Studio for this school project.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Advanced Association Rule Mining Techniques for Large-Scale Datasets using Python</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In this school project, I implemented and compared several advanced association rule mining algorithms, including the Apriori algorithm,
            PCY algorithm, Random Sampling, SON algorithm, and the multihash version of the PCY algorithm. The primary objective was to uncover meaningful 
            associations and frequent itemsets within massive datasets, and to assess the performance and effectiveness of each algorithm in this context. 
            I conducted thorough experiments, analyzing various factors such as runtime efficiency, memory utilization, and the accuracy of association rule 
            discovery. To evaluate the algorithms, I utilized two diverse datasets and explored different sample percentages (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%) as 
            well as support thresholds (1%, 2%, and 5%). I also paid specific attention to the number of false positives for Random Sampling, shedding light on 
            its performance in the association rule mining domain.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Dota 2 Scrim Tracker: Simple Data Entry, Storage, and Analysis Tool using Google Sheets</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Dota 2 Scrim Tracker is a personal project that leverages Google Sheets to enable easy data entry, storage, and analysis of Dota 2 scrimmage matches. 
            Dota 2 is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game known for its competitive gameplay and strategic team-based matches. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Dota 2 Scrim Tracker in Google Sheets, you can effortlessly enter essential match details such as team names, match ids, side, pick priority, 
            heroes, and other relevant information. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            The project also offers basic statistical analysis using simple functions available in Google Sheets. By utilizing functions like "if," "concatenate," 
            "countifs," "divide," and "sum," you can calculate essential statistics to gain insights into your team's performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, there is filtering that enable you to sort and retrieve specific scrimmage data based on team names, match ids, side, pick priority, heroes, and other 
            relevant information. This feature simplifies the process of tracking performance, identifying trends, and analyzing team dynamics within your scrimmage matches.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Showcasing My Work: Building My Website Portfolio with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In this personal project, I leverage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an impressive online showcase of my skills, achievements, and projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            With HTML, I structure the content of my website portfolio, ensuring a well-organized presentation of information. By utilizing semantic tags, I 
            enhance accessibility and improve search engine visibility, making it easier for visitors to navigate and explore my portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through CSS, I unleash my design creativity, crafting visually appealing styles that elevate the aesthetics of my portfolio. I customize layouts, 
            select color schemes, and implement typography choices to create a cohesive and visually pleasing experience for visitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript plays a pivotal role in adding interactivity to my portfolio. While primarily used for implementing collapsible sections, JavaScript 
            enables visitors to expand and collapse project details for a seamless browsing experience. By leveraging JavaScript, I create dynamic elements 
            that enhance user engagement and provide a user-friendly interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the project, I prioritize responsiveness to ensure that my website portfolio adapts flawlessly to various devices and screen sizes. 
            By employing responsive design techniques, I guarantee that visitors can access and explore my portfolio effortlessly, whether on desktops, tablets, 
            or mobile devices.
